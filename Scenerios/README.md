# Scenerios
Since our load tests will be half dependent on serverless-chrome, which requires downloading and installation of 600MB of files. We will store the scenerios functions in here.

So after you get serverless-chrome installed, just copy paste all files from this folder to serverless-chrome folder, and within serverless-chrome folder, do `yarn deploy`
